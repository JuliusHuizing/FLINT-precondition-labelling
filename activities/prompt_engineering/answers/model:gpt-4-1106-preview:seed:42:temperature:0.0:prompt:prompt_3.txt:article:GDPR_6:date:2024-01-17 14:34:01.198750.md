To construct an act frame from the provided source norm, we need to identify the action, actor, object, recipient, preconditions, and postconditions. Let's break down the source norm step-by-step to extract these elements:

1. **Action**: The norm describes the action of "processing" personal data.

2. **Actor**: The actor in this context is the "controller" who is responsible for the processing of personal data.

3. **Object**: The object of the action is "personal data."

4. **Recipient**: The recipient is the "data subject," whose personal data is being processed.

5. **Preconditions**: The preconditions are the conditions under which the processing of personal data is considered lawful. These are:
   - The data subject has given consent for specific purposes.
   - Processing is necessary for the performance of a contract with the data subject.
   - Processing is necessary for compliance with a legal obligation of the controller.
   - Processing is necessary to protect the vital interests of the data subject or another person.
   - Processing is necessary for a task carried out in the public interest or in the exercise of official authority.
   - Processing is necessary for the legitimate interests pursued by the controller or a third party, with exceptions for the protection of the data subject's interests or rights, especially for children.
   - An additional note that point (f) does not apply to public authorities performing their tasks.

6. **Postconditions**: The postconditions are not explicitly stated in the norm, but we can infer that the result of the action is that the processing of personal data becomes lawful under the specified conditions.

Given this analysis, the act frame in JSON format would look like this:

```json
{
  "Act": "process personal data",
  "Action": "process",
  "Actor": "controller",
  "Object": "personal data",
  "Recipient": "data subject",
  "Preconditions": [
    {
      "OR": [
        "the data subject has given consent to the processing of his or her personal data for one or more specific purposes",
        "processing is necessary for the performance of a contract to which the data subject is party",
        "processing is necessary for compliance with a legal obligation to which the controller is subject",
        "processing is necessary in order to protect the vital interests of the data subject or of another natural person",
        "processing is necessary for the performance of a task carried out in the public interest or in the exercise of official authority vested in the controller",
        "processing is necessary for the purposes of the legitimate interests pursued by the controller or by a third party, except where such interests are overridden by the interests or fundamental rights and freedoms of the data subject which require protection of personal data, particularly where the data subject is a child"
      ]
    },
    {
      "EXCEPTION": "Point (f) of the first subparagraph shall not apply to processing carried out by public authorities in the performance of their tasks"
    }
  ],
  "Creating_postcondition": "processing of personal data is lawful",
  "Terminating_postcondition": null
}
```

This act frame captures the essence of the normative actions described in the source norm, including the conditions under which personal data processing is considered lawful and the resulting state of lawfulness.
