The given source norm outlines the conditions under which the processing of personal data can be considered lawful. Let's break down the information to extract the relevant components for the act frame:

1. **Act**: The act described in the norm is the "processing of personal data."
2. **Actor**: The actor in this context is the "controller" who is responsible for the processing of personal data.
3. **Object**: The object of the action is "personal data."
4. **Recipient**: The recipient is the "data subject" whose personal data is being processed.
5. **Preconditions**: The conditions that must be met for the processing to be lawful are outlined in the norm. These include conditions related to consent, contractual performance, legal obligations, vital interests, public interest, and legitimate interests. We need to extract these conditions and structure them appropriately.
6. **Postconditions**: The norm does not explicitly mention any specific postconditions, so we will leave this field as null.

Now, let's extract the specific conditions and structure them into the act frame.
